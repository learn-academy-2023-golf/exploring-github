### Additional Driver Swaps

Once each member of the team has contributed code to the GitHub repository, the swapping process gets a bit simpler. Each driver will begin their coding session by pulling the new code from GitHub.

```bash
git pull origin branch-name
```

Each member of the team will end their coding session with the git workflow.

```bash
git status
git add file-name.js
git commit -m "detailed message with as much detail as possible"
git push origin branch-name
```
